		<span class="boxhead "> Chicken</span>
		<p class="hell">A chicken is a bird. One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles. The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are secondary sexual characteristics and are more prominent in the male.</p>

		<div class="boxhead1"> Beef </div>
		<p class="hell">Beef is a staple of American mealtime. Nutritious. Delicious. It is Americana on a plate. Producing beef requires the dedication of farmers and ranchers across the United States, and proper management of grazing animals can rebuild the health of pastures and rangelands. </p>

		<div class="boxhead2"> Sushi </div>
		<p class="hell">Almost synonymous with Japanese cuisine and one of Japan’s major symbols, sushi is one of the most mind-boggling yet delicious types of food in the world. The idea of eating raw fish may make you cringe at first, but there’s a reason why it is the beloved food of the Japanese people for centuries.</p>
